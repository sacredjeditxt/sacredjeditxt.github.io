    <p>If I am one with the Force in life,
        <br>Shall I not be one likewise in death?
        <br>What then is death to a Jedi?
        <br>Lo: But the changing of the tide.</p>
    <p>Yet if I despise oneness in life,
        <br>Shall I then accept it in death?
        <br>What then is death to the Sith?
        <br>Lo: Annihilation and ruin.</p>
    <p>The dark side of the Force is founded on a conception of the self as a thing separate from the Force. To "master" the dark side is to hold oneself above and beyond the very concept of interwoven life.</p>
    <p>Adherents to this paradigm (for it need not be a codified philosophy) ultimately view death as a conclusion or termination of the self, rather than a continuation or transformation of the interconnected web of the living.</p>
    <p>All beings live on after death in the Force of Others, whether in the cosmic metaphysical form of a so-called Force ghost, or simply in the ripples of our lives' effects on the lives of others, and of all life that follows.</p>
    <p>But to the dark side such life, being absent of control, is not life at all.</p>
    <p>The pursuit of the dark side is ultimately motivated by a fear of endings. While there may be other enemies of power and those who crave it, none is greater than the inevitability of resolution, and of change.</p>
    <p>Thence springs the seemingly relentless search for immortality by any mean necessary which we witness in those Jedi who have fallen from the light.</p>
    <p>Yet, in refusing to die, in placing their will above the will of others and even the will of the Force, they subject themselves to a life of misery, surrounded by the Force, yet taking no part in the fruits thereof.</p>
    <p>They transmute the energy of life itself into a mere tool or resource, to be manipulated, spent, exchanged, and ruined for personal gain.</p>
    <p>But their curse is twofold: Not only do they live a life of internalized self-exile; they also meet death utterly, even intentionally, unprepared.</p>
