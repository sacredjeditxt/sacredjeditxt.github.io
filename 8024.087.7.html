    <h2>Taken from the Writings of Frey-Li Loh</h2>

    <p>A Primitive Treatise on the Nature, Detection, and Classification of Vergence Patterns in the Force.</p>
    <p>Proving Also the Twin Conjecttures of Force Vergences Put Forth by Master Beru Sriett</p>
    <p>And Other Observations</p>
    <p>By Master Frey-Li Loh</p>
    <p>Nature:</p>
    <p>The Force is the medium in which all the universe is bound and motivated. It has no smallest partical nor largest boundary.</p>
    <p>Its qualities are apparent to the Force attuned.</p>
    <p>The Force flows dynamically, dramatically. Echos, ripples, waves, and vortices form in its energy field.</p>
    <p>In reality, this energy field is many dimensional, though it may be helpful to think of the Force as the rippling surface of a pond, or the ever changing currents of a stream.</p>
    <p>For countless generations, the Force attuned have been drawn to places they consider powerful in the Force.</p>
    <p>These places have become our temples and our places of refuge, each formed about a nexus of power.</p>
    <p>One: The conjecture of Force Convergence of Jedi Master Beru Sriett suggests such places are loci or convergences in the currents of the Force.</p>
    <p>Two: In the conjecture of Force divergence, Master Sriett posits that inn a balanced system, Force convergence in one place produces divergences elsewhere</p>
    <p>Proof of either of these Twin Conjectures would support the other. Sadly, without accurate measures, Master Sriett was unable to prove the conjectures before passing into the Force.</p>
    <p>Detection:</p>
    <p>When I attained the rank of Master, I immediately chartered a prospecing vessel, to search for evidence of the Twin Conjectures.</p>
    <p>I reasoned that some Force conducive material, suspended freely, might align itself with the local currents of the Force.</p>
    <p>I tried may materials before settling upon the Kyber from my own saber, suspended from a thin cord of inert fiber.</p>
    <p>This proved to be effective at detecting major anomalies in the Force, but too delicate for detecting minor disturbances.</p>
    <p>We would investigate a known nexus in the remote Sluis Sector (N-Nineteen).</p>
    <h2>(Text refers to a map, not extant.)</h2>
    <p>Our path wound through the sector many times over, following the heading of the rudimentary Kyber compass.</p>
    <p>Our route traced the contours of the Force.</p>
    <p>Our survey of this sector took one and one half years to complete.</p>
    <p>With current tools, survey of the explorable galaxy might be completed by one dozen vessels in just one hundred and fifty years.</p>
    <p>The vergence is immediately apparent, centered, as predicted upon the nexus in the Dagobah System!</p>
    <p>The density of currents is varied, in accordance with the second conjecture of Master Sriett.</p>
    <p>Of the First Conjecture: Nexi of power are points of vergence in the energy field of the Force. Q.E.D</p>
    <p>Of the Second Conjecture: Convergence in the Force must produce divergence elsewhere. Q.E.D</p>
    <p>We are satisfied that our data serves as adequate proof of the Twin Conjectures of the late Master Sriett.</p>
    <p>Classification:</p>
    <h2>(Text refers to figures, not extant.)</h2>
    <p>Fig. one. Free vergence - unstable</p>
    <p>Fig. two. Single-node feedback vergence - moderately stable</p>
    <p>Fig. three. Double-node feedback vergence - very stable</p>
    <p>Unstable vergences diverge quickly. The strongest vergences are stabilized by feedback loops.</p>
    <p>Even mild interaction with the Force produces temporary unstable vergences. More focused use of the Force might produce a stable vergence?</p>
    <p>- Have the Force attuned gathered at vergence points, or has the act of gathering induced convergence? -</p>
    <p>Fig. four. Divergence region. Low density of Force currents. Usually in open space, far from lifving beings.</p>
    <p>Fig. five. Wave vergence, or threshhold. Mild to moerate vergence with no distinct focal point. Often a secondary phenomenon.</p>
    <p>Impossible to predict the "darkness" or "lightness" of a nexus based only upon the shape or strength of the vergence. Further study is required.</p>
    <p>Conjecture: Raw Kyber crystals exhibit weak, fluctuating vergence, tempered or Force aligned crystals emit stronger near-field vergence.</p>
    <p>Seacibd Expedition:</p>
    <p>An anonymous benefactor has commissioned my second expedition. They wish me to investigate an anomaly deep in the unknown regions.</p>
    <p>They are fully funding the expedition, expected to take three years. When I return, I shall pen a more complete treatise, incorporating the data acquired over the course of both investigations.</p>
    <p>We depart from Coruscant in one week.</p>
    <p>Approximate coordinates: F-Seven.</p>
    <h2>(End of original record.)</h2>
    <p>It has been six years since Master Loh's departure. We have received no word from her, or the being who sponsored the second expedition.</p>
    <p>The unknown regions are treacherous. It is too dangerous to send a search party.</p>
    <p>We believe she has been lost to the void and reunited with the Force.</p>
    <p>Attempts to replicate her Kyber compass experiments have failed. It is unknown whether her methodology differs from what she described, or if her crystal was uniquely suited to the task.</p>
