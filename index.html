    <p>The brightest stars have hearts of Kyber. They breathe out life in abundance. They guide safely the lost navigator. They are true exemplars of the Jedi.</p>
    <p>The Force flows through Kyber as it does through all living things. The Kyber is attuned to the living Force. Can sense its presence. Can focus its energy.</p>
    <p>From ancient times the Jedi have been drawn to Kyber crystals. The first fragments were found on riverbanks and within meteorite craters.</p>
    <p>We discovered abundant Kyber in the fissures and caves of distant worlds. Utapau. Lothal. Christophsis. Each is a sacred pilgrimage of the Jedi.</p>
    <p>Each crystal is an embodiment of the will of the Force with desires and destinies. With our help some became beauteous sculpture. Others lightsabers.</p>
    <p>Kyber crystal is the most vital component of a laser sword or lightsaber. The crystal focuses raw energy and emits a solid beam of plasma.</p>
    <p>The lightsaber is more than a tool. It is an extension of the Jedi. Kyber and Jedi become one in the Force through the sacred Rites of Sabercraft.</p>
    <p>This knowledge has been passed down through countless generations. From master to apprentice. From the great sabersmiths of Tython down to this day.</p>
    <p>C One. The Rite of Discovery.</p>
    <p>Let the Force guide you to your crystal. The crystal will call out to you or it may answer your call. Trust in the Force to unite you.</p>
    <p>The call is most readily heard during the first and third phase of each star cycle. With patience the Jedi may hear it in any season.</p>
    <p>Choose your crystal carefully. Incompatible crystals will feel cold to the touch or repulsive to the mind. They will resist your efforts in the Force.</p>
    <p>Size and complexity of the crystal determine the optimal power input and frequency. Larger crystals require greater energy to establish a stable beam.</p>
    <p>The early sabersmiths rejected any crystal larger than a wrath tooth or smaller than the seed of a heart berry.</p>
    <p>Most commonly the call of the Kyber eminates from the exposed crystal. In rare cases however the ideal crystal lies beneath the surface.</p>
    <p>Take care when extracting your crystal. Treat all Kyber as sacred. If you must remove other than your chosen crystal do so with soberness and reverance.</p>
    <p>C Two. The First Rite of Alignment.</p>
    <p>When the Jedi and the chosen crystal are first united a change is wrought upon the Kyber. The lattice structure shifts to align with the being of the Jedi.</p>
    <p>Pure Kyber is naturally transparent. Only once bonded does the crystal take on a color to reflect the nature of its chosen Jedi.</p>
    <p>The color of the attenuated crystal is deeply meaningful to its Jedi. It may reflect their purpose or their relationship to others or to the universe.</p>
    <p>Ponder carefully the meaning of the color of your crystal but do not seek to divine the heart of your fellow Jedi by their saber alone.</p>
    <p>C Three. The Rite of the Forge.</p>
    <p>In times past lightsabers were forged for the Jedi by dedicated sabersmiths using crystals obtained from across the galaxy.</p>
    <p>After a terrible siege on Tython rendered the Old Forge unusable the knowledge of saber construction was passed to all Jedi lest it be lost forever.</p>
