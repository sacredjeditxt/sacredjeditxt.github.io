    <p>A great invsible vascular system circulates the lifeblood of the galaxy</p>
    <p>The Force flows where it is needed, bringing richness of life to the extremities of being</p>
    <p>The Force rushes through us in pulsing waves, steady and dynamic</p>
    <p>That which drives this constant pulse remains a mystery to the Jedi</p>
    <p>But then why should we expect those who reject Passion to recognize that a circulatory system requires a powerful Heart</p>
    <p>The Force has a heart or rather it ought to</p>
    <p>Darth Cisor tried in vain for many years to locate a heart at the center of the galaxy</p>
    <p>Cisor delved deeper than any other being has yet dared to explore who lived to tell the tale</p>
    <p>His apprentice, Darth Timate grew weary of her masters stubborn obsession and slew him</p>
    <p>With his blood still fresh on her hands she peered deep into the Force and saw the truth</p>
    <p>The Force has not one heart but many</p>
    <p>Every being in their relative meager strength contributes to the scattered arrhythmiatic pulse of the galaxy</p>
    <p>Sporadic Random Inefficient</p>
    <p>The Force has not one heart but many</p>
    <p>It is a wonder that the Force as survived this long with such a feeble semblance of a heart</p>
    <p>There is no question that without a mighty ruling heart the Force will die in time</p>
    <p>The very fate of our galaxy depends on our ability to bring order to its disparate parts until all life beats to the guiding rule of a single will</p>
    <p>Let us work tirelessly then to enlarge and consolodate the power of the Sith</p>
    <p>Let us heal the broken heart of the lifegiving Force</p>
    <p>Let us make in our image a new heart and will and voice</p>
    <p>In the place of many make One Heart of the Force</p>
