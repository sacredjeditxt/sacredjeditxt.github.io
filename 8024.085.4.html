    <h1><a href="#">The Nature of the Force</a></h1>
    <h2>Taken from the Journal of Elliaan Ghigh</h2>
    <h3>8023.001.5</h3>
    <p>The Force is a cosmic soup created by all living things.</p>
    <p>All of us beings are its ingredients. Even as we absorb its flavors, we can in turn influence the flavor of the soup around us.</p>
    <p>The light side of the Force are those flavors which act in harmony with the whole; the dark side refers to flavors which are in conflict with it.</p>
    <p>To be in harmony, a flavor must be temperate so as not to overpower the taste of the soup.</p>
    <p>Dark side flavors have no such restriction. This is why the dark side may at first appear to be stronger than the light.</p>
    <p>But look closer, and you sill see that the light side is better supported by the host of other flavors in the galaxy.</p>
    <p>The only hope that the dark side has of succeeding is to overpower and corrupt the flavor of the entire soup.</p>
